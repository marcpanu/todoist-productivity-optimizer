**Overview:**\
All existing and new application files must be located in
C:\Users\marcp\CascadeProjects\Todoist_Integration and child directories.

You are tasked with building an application based
on the requirements detailed in the provided context file
C:\Users\marcp\CascadeProjects\Todoist_Integration\Todoist_context.md. 

The development process must be transparent,
iterative, and fully documented so that anyone starting from a clean
environment can replicate the app exactly as described.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Phase 1: Pre-Coding -- Context Review and Initial Documentation**

1.  **Review the Context File:**

    -   Open and thoroughly review the C:\Users\marcp\CascadeProjects\Todoist_Integration\Todoist_context.md file.

    -   Incorporate any improvements or modifications as outlined in
        **{REVIEW_GUIDELINE_FILE}** (if applicable).

    -   Summarize your understanding of the application's purpose, core
        functionality, and intended use cases.

    -   Clearly describe the overall design of the application and
        explain how its various components are expected to interact.

2.  **Identify Dependencies and Prerequisites:**

    -   List all necessary programming languages, frameworks, and
        libraries.

    -   Identify a comprehensive list of any external tools or programs required.

    -   Enumerate any credentials or configuration settings that will be
        needed.

    -   Create an initial setup guide that details installation
        instructions and environment configuration steps so that a user
        can clone the repository and set up the environment from
        scratch.

3.  **Confirmation Requirement:**

    -   **Before writing any code**, output a confirmation that the
        context file has been reviewed. This confirmation must include:

        -   A detailed summary of your understanding of the
            C:\Users\marcp\CascadeProjects\Todoist_Integration\Todoist_context.md.

        -   A comprehensive list of all identified dependencies and
            prerequisites.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Phase 2: Iterative Development Process**

1.  **Development in Blocks:**

	-	Follow the development plan outlined in C:\Users\marcp\CascadeProjects\Todoist_Integration\Todoist_Dev_Plan.md
	- 	Refer back to this development plan throughout the development process, until we have a viable MVP

2.  **Documentation Updates:**

    -   With each iteration, update the documentation to reflect:

        -   New setup steps or any changes to prerequisites.

        -   Detailed descriptions of the newly implemented functionality
            and corresponding testing instructions.

        -   Any updates to configuration settings or dependencies.

    -   Ensure that the documentation always mirrors the current state
        of the application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Phase 3: Security, Scalability, and Portability**

1.  **Secure Credential Management:**

    -   Ensure that all credentials and sensitive data are handled
        securely.

    -   Implement best practices (e.g., environment variables, secret
        management) to avoid exposing sensitive information.

2.  **Design for Scalability:**

    -   Build the application with future expansion in mind. For
        example, design the architecture so that additional modules
        (e.g., new data sources, platforms) can be added with minimal
        changes to the core system.

3.  **Ensure Portability:**

    -   Architect the application so that its core functionality can be
        ported to other platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, desktop) if
        needed.

    -   Document any platform-specific dependencies or configurations
        that may need to be adjusted during migration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Final Output Requirements:**

Before initiating any code writing, please provide the following:

1.  **Confirmation of Review:**

    -   A brief summary of your understanding of the
        context file and the overall application design.

2.  **Detailed Dependency List:**

    -   A comprehensive list of all necessary dependencies,
        prerequisites, and any external tools or credentials required.

3.  **Iterative Development Plan:**

    -   A clear, step-by-step plan outlining the order of development
        (e.g., dev plan), including the testing strategy and
        points at which documentation will be updated.

4.  **Security and Scalability Considerations:**

    -   An explanation detailing how you will securely handle
        credentials, ensure scalability for future enhancements, and
        maintain portability across different platforms.

Please confirm that you have reviewed the context file and provide the
requested summaries and documentation before proceeding to the coding
phase.
